# EF Core entity with dictionary sample

"Simple" sample of a possible way (maybe there's a simpler way?) to have a dictionary in a POCO, that acts as a container of related entities.

This is very likely useless and overkill, so I don't recommend doing it at all, but just wanted to try it out and see what I could get.
